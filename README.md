Android application that keeps score during a basketball game. Originally created at HackPoly 2018

# TO DO
I want to do more with this, but I currently don't have Android phone to test it with. The Hackathon was able to provide me with a Kindle Fire Phone. But once I have an Android, there are some features that I'd like to put in. </br >

• Statistics for players </br >
• Input team names </br >
• Score correction </br >
• A timer </br >
• Possible bluetooth capablity with a scoreboard? </br >

But yeah I would definitely put more thought into this if I had an Android. So keep on the lookout!
